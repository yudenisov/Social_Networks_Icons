It is required following files for this project:

* All images from catalog /img;

You must copy these catalogs into the root catalog of your site or into the root catalog of your theme template or plugin for a cms. After you must order this css file at your html pages with a tag <link>.

After you can change the code of css file and write code on your web page (see the file example.html)

Using
---------

To choose the necessary social icons You must point a block ID, an icon class and a social service class you need from the list of available services.

In these examples, you can change safely a href attributes in <a> tags, margins, a width of main block elements. Changes at a background position and a backgrounds width and height are no safe. Changes at the background URL are not possible.

To insert the social icons on Your Page You must copy css and img folder onto a root of site or a template folder 'as is'. You may not change files in these catalogs if You have no need a serious occasion.
